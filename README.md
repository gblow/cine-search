## CineSearch Application


## Overview
CineSearch is a web application that allows users to search for movies and tv-shows based on the genre you are in the mood for and what streaming service you would like to use. The application uses a movie database (WatchMode) API to retrieve movie ids and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to present users with the top 20 options. Another service used is the trailer (KinoCheck) API, to retrieve a trailer along with the results. The user also has an ability to add the selections into a watchlist and log if they have been watched
